# Treecam
A WordPress plugin that dynamically scrapes images from a user-specified folder (using an absolute URL) and displays them as a responsive gallery with Lightbox support. Perfect for displaying camera feeds or any folder-based image collections. I made it to share images of my Monkey Puzzle Tree uploaded by my REOLink camera.
